### Peer Feedback

ϟ He works hard and always produces a good quality MR and he cares a lot about the projects he works on. I've never seen him half-ass anything.
 - CTO at Acro Commerce

ϟ Tony is a very solid dev, has a high attention to detail, very much cares about the work he is doing. He is often the first to jump in to answer other's questions. I always feel like the work will be done "right" when it's assigned to Tony.
 - CXO at Acro Commerce

ϟ Tony, the Gesso guru, is a cornerstone of the Gesso team. He consistently offers help and fulfills those requests with an ever-growing skill set, all while maintaining his humility and humanity. His ability to normalize struggles, bad days, and the daily challenges of development is a testament to his resilience and honesty. Tony also dedicates time to investigating problems and areas of improvement, which is why team leaders often seek his insights in decision-making. He routinely exceeds expectations, and it's truly inspiring to witness his continuous growth.
 - Lead Architect at Acro Commerce

ϟ Detailed and explicit when it comes to providing MR feedback, ticket details and highlighting discovered issues. Quick to respond and provide help if you ever require assistance in gesso. If there is ever a nebulous area of documentation Tony is very helpful at providing citation or providing the "missing links" in these scenarios. Overall, very thorough with code, feedback and cares about ensuring the code delivered in gesso is of quality and follows best practices.
- Sofware Developer at Acro Commerce

ϟ Tony has done a really great job becoming the SME on Gesso. He has the ability to jump in and support devs with issues. He has a great understanding of how things work and finding root cause issues. If blocked he has no issues explaining the issue, reaching out, but also being able to pivot. He has been extremely helpful while the Gesso has seen less leadership involvement on the product. He is very involved in our scrum ceremonies and will point out improvements, or ensure team mates follow the correct workflow.
- Product Owner at Acro Commerce

ϟ Tony's communication is STELLAR. I don't think he understands how helpful it is, I NEVER need to follow up with him. It's amazing seriously, my other teams need to learn. Sometimes talking to developers is like pulling teeth, he makes it SO easy.
- Product Manager at Acro Commerce

I've been working on Gitlab for the last couple of years, so you will notice there's not alot of green squares below. Here are some blue ones instead
