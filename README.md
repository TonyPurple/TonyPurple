### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working through a Software Engineering Remote Flex Immersive at General Assembly.
- ⚡ I love pro wrestling, soccer, hip hop and R&B, learning Japanese and programming.
- 🌱  I’m hungry to learn, like to feel challenged, cool with feedback, and prefer to avoid brilliant jerks.
- 🌍 I am compiling a professional portfolio of full-stack applications to demonstrate job-ready skills to potential employers and collaborators.

- ⚡ Fun fact: It was my childhood dream to become a professional wrestler. While life took me down other roads (not to mention having the athletic ability of a software developer), at the age of 31 I spent a summer literally learning the ropes at a professional wrestling school on Vancouver Island. At that point, I never intended to pursue it as any sort of career but I suppose I was hoping to prove something to my childhood self. My summer as Surrey Jack will be as close as I get to that childhood dream, but I am determined to turn this adulthood dream into a reality. I am happy that exploring life's curiosities has lead me into development!
